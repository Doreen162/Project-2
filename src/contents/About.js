          communication skills, working well in a team, self-movitation, good
          time management, critical thinking, determination and persistance. My

          My love for computers started at Naspers Labs. Web development is my
          centre of interest, I always love the idea of building an application
          from scratch. Most of my work is available on Codepen and Github.
